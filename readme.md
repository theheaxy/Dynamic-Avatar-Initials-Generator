# Dynamic Avatar Initials Generator

This Python script generates a PNG image of initials based on a given name. The background color of the avatar is dynamically selected from a predefined list of color hex codes.

## Prerequisites

Before running the script, make sure you have the following installed:

- **Python**: Version 3.6 or higher.
- **Pillow**: A Python Imaging Library (PIL) fork that provides easy-to-use methods to create and manipulate images.

You can install Pillow using pip if you don't have it already:

```bash
pip install pillow
```

## Usage

Clone this repository to your local machine.
```bash
git clone https://github.com/theheaxy/Dynamic-Avatar-Initials-Generator.git
```
Open a terminal in the project directory.
Edit and run the script with the name as an argument to generate the avatar:

```bash
python export-avatar.py
```
This will create a PNG image with initials and a randomly selected background color.
